Needing to head out to John's birthday party at Aida's house leaving Regina and Hayden alone at Ro's, Ro and Martin arrive home to find Regina and her car gone, Regina's bag still there, and a dead man on Ro's front porch, he who eventually is identified as Craig Walker. This murder case is the first as lead for Detective Arthur Smith, and the first for him working under his wife, Captain Lynn Smith. During or subsequent to Arthur and Lynn's initial visit to Ro's house to investigate, two additional people are discovered safe and alive in the house: baby Hayden, hidden in the bathroom bathtub; and Rory Brown, an apparent friend of Regina and Craig's who was hiding. What information Rory is willing to divulge is that he and Craig have a rap sheet of minor crimes, the latest, for which they were just released from a two-day stint in jail, being check fraud. Martin and Ro, often with the assistance of her murder club friends, decide to investigate on their own in their primary goal to find a still alive Regina, often not informing Arthur and Lynn of what they are doing. In the process, Ro wonders if the baby truly is Regina's. Two other issues arise during the investigation: whether Arthur and Lynn can maintain a happy marriage and professional relationship in their current positions; and if Ro and Martin, if they ever do decide to get married, are ready to be parents."

When Detective Moran eventually tells Alex his belief about Nick, she is initially reluctant to ""spy"" on her father. But Nick's behavior - getting rid of everything related to Helen from the house, wanting to be buddies with his children more than be a father figure, buying expensive gifts for them some which would have been against their mother's wishes, and not taking on any of the domestic duties of the house leaving those all to Alex - and Alex's stronger want to find her mother's killer lead Alex to continue to assist Detective Moran, which includes not being able to tell anyone, including her siblings, her friends and obviously Nick, what she is doing. This task becomes all consuming for Alex, whose personal life, academic life and emotions take their toll because of it, mostly because she can't discuss what's going on with anyone but Detective Moran, and as she views her father in this different light.

What further affects the relationship between the three is that Stella is in the early stage of pregnancy with her and Stanley's first child.

And Charlie's twin brother, pretentious Donald, has moved into his house with a goal of also becoming a screenwriter. Despite not admiring Donald as a screenwriter, Charlie asks for his advice.

After Hiroshima Mon Amour uses various visual and aural strategies to layer and analyze instances of violence and trauma. Titles, silence, brief sync sound, and music are used to create a new story out of an old one. The allegorical couple of the 1959 film is played by ten interconnecting actors who blur distinctions of ethnicity, race, and gender, undermining the categories that are often used to rationalize violence. And as in the Resnais/Duras film, eroticism and violence are interwoven. Various scenes in black and white are faithfully recreated from Hiroshima mon amour. Contemporary material downloaded from the Internet, a remix of the score and sound design of the original, and particular uses of color become other characters in the video."

Upon a cursory exam of the rooms, the father appeared at the landing brusquely saying that it was nothing and no one was in the house. A day or so later, a very distinct, raised mark was discovered on the boy's shoulder. A medical exam was inconclusive. The boy was told to lie about the mark and how he had received it. He lied about it for over 45 years. He kept the fear of that night, the shame of his father's dismissal of his account, and the memory of that almond-eyed visitor locked tight in his mind. The boy grew into a perfectly normal man who lived in a normal house, with his normal wife and children - except for his obsessive preoccupation with home security, paralyzing fear of open skies or deep water, and his abiding sense that he was being watched. With the help of some very good and open-minded friends, he finally came to terms with his memories and the truth that he had a Close Encounter of the Fourth Kind. But there was something missing; something that was just out of his reach. He could not remember how he got to the top of those stairs, why had the entity touched him, why was he 'marked', and what did it all mean? This documentary follows him as he discovers that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life and all over the globe who have experienced something similar - he is not alone. We witness his encounter as a boy and through a technique called Quantum Hypnotherapy we 'sit-in' while a highly skilled therapist with over 40 years of experience guide him back to that Summer evening; we cheer him as he masters his fear, and we finally discover what really happened that night. Where did he go? What did he learn? What can he share with the rest of us? What will YOU do when you know the truth? This. Is. Happening. - Learn to overcome your fear and get: Answers to Alien Abduction."

In the days that follow, Frankie and Heather meet two people for whom the Mafia isn't a television show, it's their lives. Nicolette Bellafusco manages wedding bands and also happens to be the sophisticated daughter of Caesar ""The General"" Bellafusco, a new boss in the Mafia. What to Heather is hypnotically fascinating, is crushingly mundane for Nicolette and downright irritating to Frankie. Getting away from that world, however, is easier said than done. Not only are the Feds on Frankie, questioning her about her new Mafia friends, but Nicolette shows up at Frankie's band's next gig--and offers to manage them. In spite of Nicolette's Mafia pedigree, Frankie finds in Nicolette something that her own family, particularly her sashimi-obsessed mother, can't give her. As Frankie finds herself alienated from her fiancé and--ambivalently--growing closer to Nicolette, she also manages to cast herself as a featured player in a murder plot, wherein only she knows who is really out to whom. Caught between her planned marriage to Tony and her attraction to Nicolette, between her imagined identity and her real one, Frankie is discovering that ""choice"" is a relative term, especially when the bargaining chip is family. In the process, she learns that the most surprising discoveries often come when we least expect it, in the midst of great personal distress, federal investigations, and oh yeah, lasagna."

A group of fishermen are exposed to radiation from French nuclear tests in the Pacific, Dr Gautamdas mounts a daring rescue to help save the fishermen. Battling angry elements Dr Gautamdas helps the fishermen survive, saving every last one of them - but at what cost?

It is the unknown to Sally that Dave and Chrissie bring with them that affects those dreams, namely a large cache of cocaine stolen from criminal sources."

3753,Awakenings (1990),https://subslikescript.com/movie/Awakenings-99077,"1969. Dr. Malcolm Sayer is hired as a clinical physician at a psychiatric hospital in the Bronx, despite he only having a research background. The job is not ideal on his side as he has difficulties relating to people which is the reason he has focused on research projects not involving human subjects, while the hospital hires him somewhat out of desperation in not finding anyone else with the qualifications who wants the job. Most of his patients are in a semi-catatonic state and are housed in what some of the orderlies coin the ""garden"" ward, where all they can do for the patients is water and feed them. He notices that some of the patients, despite their generally catatonic state, respond in unusual ways to certain stimuli. In doing some research, he also finds that some common bonds between these patients are that they suffered from encephalitis in the 1920s or 1930s, and that their physical states are like they have Parkinson's disease frozen in time. As such, he is able to convince, albeit reluctantly, his skeptical boss, Dr. Kaufman, to administer an expensive experimental drug therapy on only one patient with family consent. That patient is forty-one year old Leonard Lowe, who has been in his current state since he was eleven years old, and who has been supported by his loving mother through all these years. As the drug therapy ""awakens"" Leonard, there are several issues that come into play. Malcolm has to try and convince Kaufman and the hospital administration to extend the therapy to the other patients. Despite not knowing the long term effects, Leonard, who was aware of his surroundings through his catatonic state, may have mixed emotions about his situation, wanting both to be treated as human being and an experiment guinea pig to ensure that what is happening benefits him and others in the long run. Mrs. Lowe may be unprepared for the new Leonard, she expecting who she remembers as a sweet eleven year old boy. Through all these issues, what may be the most illuminating issue for Malcolm is the need to stimulate the human spirit, including his own in dealing with people around him."

Why do we seem to be hardwired for mystical experience? In these times of existential crisis, there has been an explosion of research into consciousness. After four centuries of silence, scientists are confronting the ""Big Questions"", cutting a window into a realm previously held tight by philosophy and religion: AWARE follows six brilliant researchers, approaching the greatest of all mysteries from radically different perspectives, from within and without: through high-tech brain research and Eastern meditation, by scientifically exploring inner space through psychedelic substances and by investigating the consciousness of plants. Scientists are arriving at new insights - some have been integral to Indigenous knowledge for millenia. AWARE opens as a science film but emerges well beyond the explicable, ultimately leading one on a voyage upon the ocean of consciousness, a contemplative, sensual, cinematographic meditation. The networks of consciousness are reflected in 'grand' imagery revealing the vast interconnectedness of Nature - from the smallest organisms, to the world of plants and animals and on to the cosmos. It invites one to experience the awe and mystery of life as the researchers do, to dive in with them, returning to see the world anew, to review long-held beliefs and assumptions and initiate one's own oceanic journey. Ultimately, to be aware one is aware. With Richard Boothby, Monica Gagliano, Roland Griffiths, Josefa Kirvin Kulix, Christof Koch, Matthieu Ricard and Mingyur Rinpoche."

With respect to the facility, what Grant has the most difficulty with are what he sees as the sadness associated with the facility's second floor - where the more advanced cases are housed - but most specifically the facility's policy of no visitors within the first thirty days of admission to allow the patient to adjust more easily to their new life there. Based on what he sees when he is finally able to visit Fiona, Grant ultimately makes a request of Marian Barque, the wife of one of the other patients, a semi-comatose Aubrey Barque, with whom Fiona has struck a friendship and who is now at home permanently with Marian.
